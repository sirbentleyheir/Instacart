# Instacart - Python

Using an app, Instacart functions as a real online grocery store. Although Instacart already has excellent sales, they still wish to learn more about their buying habits. For this project, I gather preliminary data and conduct exploratory analysis on a portion of their data to gain insights and recommend tactics for more effective segmentation based on the given criteria.

# Objective

To put things in perspective, the stakeholders in Instacart are primarily curious about the range of clients in their database and how they make purchases. They're thinking about a targeted marketing strategy because they believe they can't target everyone with the same techniques. In order to determine whether these efforts have an impact on the sales of their goods, they wish to target various clientele with relevant marketing campaigns. What this strategy might entail to make sure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the right products is determined by the analysis. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● What days of the week and hours of the day are busiest?

● What times of the day do people spend the most money?

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?

● What's the distribution amoung users in regards to their brand loyalty?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region? 

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
